## Spark

Spark is a Java SPARQL API. [SPARQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) is a query language for RDF, commonly used to access data in semantic web applications.


## Sherpa

Sherpa is a high-performance, language-agnostic, binary protocol for SPARQL processor communication. It aims to avoid the costs associated with the SPARQL Protocol (text-based, single-shot RPC style) and provide an alternative. Sherpa uses Avro to define the protocol and provide interop for multiple languages. Avro currently supports Java, C, C++, C#, Ruby, Python, and PHP.
